##  Text Tokenization

Here we are focusing on developing a pipeline for text tokenization and noise reduction, specifically for analyzing historical religious and biblical texts. Utilizing a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy, the task aims to preprocess and tokenize a dataset of Asian religious and biblical texts obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Text Cleaning and Noise Reduction:**
   - Remove successive whitespace and line breaks to standardize the text format.
   - Replace non-alphabetic characters with single whitespace to focus on alphabetic content.
   - Eliminate any leading and trailing whitespace to ensure clean token boundaries.

2. **Tokenization Techniques:**
   - **Word Tokenization:** Split the cleaned text into individual words using NLTK's `word_tokenize` method.
   - **Character Tokenization:** Tokenize the text at the character level using regular expressions.
   - **Sentence Tokenization:** Divide the text into sentences using NLTK's `sent_tokenize` method.
     
**Expected Outcomes:**

- A streamlined process for downloading, cleaning, and tokenizing large text datasets.
- Cleaned and tokenized versions of historical religious texts, ready for further analysis or machine learning applications.
